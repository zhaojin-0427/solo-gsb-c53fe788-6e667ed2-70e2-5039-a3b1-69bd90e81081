"""Multi-station relay planning.

Given one satellite state and several ground stations (each with its own
minimum elevation), the same :func:`~app.passes.find_passes` machinery is
run per station. Only its *proven* outputs are used:

- every returned window is a **proven-visible** half-open interval
  ``[start, end)`` (``start_open`` / ``end_open`` mark clipping by the search
  boundaries, ``truncated`` a cut caused by a numerical failure);
- every entry in ``uncovered_intervals`` is a time span that is neither
  proven visible nor proven invisible.

A relay chain must keep at least one station provably visible at every
instant. Consecutive responsible stations differ, and a handover is only
legal when the two proven windows overlap for a **strictly positive**
duration (a shared endpoint is not an overlap). A station's own windows are
allowed to abut (their shared endpoint needs no handover).

The set of all proven windows is split into connected components under
those relations; each component is one continuously coverable span. Inside
a component the chain with the fewest switches is found on a small DAG
(window -> later-ending, positively-overlapping window of another station);
equal switch counts are adjudicated lexicographically by the station-ID
sequence, so the result is stable. Across components the longest span wins;
spans of exactly equal length prefer fewer switches, then the earlier
start, then station IDs.

Time that no station proves visible but some station reports as uncovered is
returned in ``unknown_intervals`` -- never as "definitely invisible" and
never as coverage.

Time representation and conversion boundaries
---------------------------------------------
Every instant is converted to **whole microseconds after the search start**
the moment it enters the planner, and every comparison, subtraction and
duration verdict below is done on those integers. Float seconds never
decide an ordering: subtracting two float offsets such as ``0.3 - 0.2`` and
``0.4 - 0.3`` yields 0.10000000000000003 vs 0.09999999999999998, which would
let a plan starting later "win" despite both spanning exactly 100000 us.

- **incoming boundary** (``find_passes`` datetimes): differences of two
  UTC datetimes are timedeltas carrying whole microseconds; they become int
  microseconds once and are clipped to ``[0, span_us]``;
- **inside the planner**: abut/overlap/gap tests and the duration verdict
  are exact integer comparisons -- a 1 us gap is a real gap, a 1 us
  overlap is a positive overlap that allows a handover, a 1 us longer plan
  wins outright, and a 1 us unknown interval is reported;
- **outgoing boundary** (plan datetimes and ``*_seconds`` fields): an int
  microsecond coordinate is turned back into a datetime through
  ``timedelta(microseconds=...)`` and into an external seconds value by a
  single division ``us / 1_000_000``.
